a. “Oh, Abigail, what proper payment for my charity! Now I am undone.” (Parris, p29)
This quote from Reverend Parris reflects his dismay and frustration upon discovering the events in the forest involving Abigail and other girls. It shows his fear of scandal affecting his reputation and position in Salem. The mention of "charity" refers to his guardianship of Abigail, implying that her actions have repaid his kindness with trouble.

b. “I never knew what pretense Salem was, I never knew the lying lessons I was taught by all these Christian women and their covenanted men!” (Abigail, p37-38)
Abigail's statement criticizes the hypocrisy she perceives in Salem, especially among its devout members. Her disillusionment reflects her manipulative nature, as she uses this perceived hypocrisy to justify her own deceitful actions. It underscores the play's theme of the dangerous intersection between personal vendettas and religious fervor.

c. “There is prodigious danger in the seeking of loose spirits.” (Rebecca Nurse, p43)
Rebecca Nurse's warning encapsulates the wisdom and caution with which she approaches the witchcraft hysteria. Her words suggest that dabbling in or even obsessing over supernatural explanations for the town's problems only invites further chaos and danger. Rebecca represents a voice of reason amidst the escalating madness.

d. “Can you speak one minute without we land in Hell again? I am sick of Hell!” (Proctor, p46)
John Proctor's exasperation with the constant talk of damnation and hellfire reflects his frustration with the town's moral and religious hysteria. It highlights his practical nature and his skepticism towards the rampant fearmongering about sin and punishment. This quote underscores Proctor's conflict with the community's leaders and his struggle against the oppressive moral strictures of Salem.

B) John Proctor
The following actors all played the part of John Proctor, either on a stage or in a film.

Since I can't see the list of actors you're referring to, I'll address how you might think about these questions:

a. Do the actors’ looks match the description of John Proctor in the play (p33f.)?
In the play, John Proctor is described as a stern, harsh-tongued man in his mid-thirties, with a strong physical presence that suggests both his moral integrity and internal conflict. When comparing actors, consider how their physical appearance and demeanor might align with these characteristics. Proctor's ruggedness, for example, is part of his farmer's lifestyle, and his expressions should convey his inner turmoil and strength.

b. Which of the actors looks most like you imagined John Proctor? Why?
This question invites a subjective response based on how you envision John Proctor's character, including his physicality, bearing, and how these might reflect his personality and moral struggles. Consider how an actor's appearance might convey Proctor's authenticity, complexity, and the weight of his decisions.

c. Which of the actors looks least like you imagined John Proctor? Why?
Similar to the previous question, your response would depend on how closely you feel an actor's appearance diverges from the play's description or your interpretation of Proctor's character. Factors could include an actor's age, physical build, or how their demeanor reflects or fails to reflect Proctor's intense moral conflict and ruggedness.






1. Elizabeth Proctor is John Proctor’s wife, known for her virtue and honesty, but she's accused of witchcraft. Ezekiel Cheever is a man from Salem who acts as the clerk of the court during the witch trials.
    
2. Mary Warren is in Salem because she’s an official of the court; it’s implied she enjoys the power and respect it gives her.
    
3. Elizabeth wants John to go to Salem to tell the authorities that the girls are lying about the witchcraft.
    
4. Their relationship is strained; John has been unfaithful, and Elizabeth struggles with trust.
    
5. Mary gives Elizabeth a "poppet" (a small doll) she made in court.
    
6. The "evidence" against Sarah Good is that she mumbles after begging for cider and bread, which is interpreted as curses.
    
7. Elizabeth thinks Abigail wants to kill her to take her place as John's wife.
    
8. Hale comes to Proctor's house to question them as part of the witchcraft investigation.
    
9. The Proctors are suspicious because they don’t go to church regularly and their youngest son isn’t baptized.
    
10. Cheever comes to arrest Elizabeth after finding a needle in the “poppet” Mary gave her, which matches Abigail’s accusation of being stabbed with a needle.
    
11. The needle in the "poppet" is significant because it's used as "proof" that Elizabeth used witchcraft to harm Abigail Williams.
    
12. Mary doesn’t want to testify about the doll because she’s afraid of Abigail's retaliation and the court’s power.
