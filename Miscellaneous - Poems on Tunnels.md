# Introduction

miles on miles of tunnels underground 
winding down in spirals straight 
and finding themselves in straights going round 
not hidden in any other way 
than in plain and direct sight.

Alexandre
time's up!, be so kind as to hand in your exams. 
See you next week guys, tuesdays' the homework's due. 
Everyone left, likely to unwind, and later party in their dorms - 
I however did not feel that urge, 
I did not suffer from any mental curse
as to poison myself, with cigarettes or strong booze 
the control of my mind was far to precious to ever loose,
exactly when on my behalf 
i needed to follow this very rule. 
No i was found in libraries, these places of wisdom and character 
these fortresses of cunning wit and evergroing love, 
theses stories told were so much more than ever experienced in the theater,
that are those orgies, that they call fun
when learning is all them behoves. 
No i was not found there, because the body is a temple 
and all we really are, is on the run 
from the looming threat thats symbol is the dove.

time's up!, be so kind as to hand in your exams. 
See you next week guys, tuesdays' the homework's due. 
As soon as these words cam to my ears
i let go a sigh of relief. 
this bane of my existance is finally over, 
i can finally head to things more important, 
finally think about being good as a lover, 
finally think about all the great things i do when finishing this thing. 
but first of all, unwind for a bit. 
This last week felt like a somewhat of a bad skit, 
im tired, maybe alexandres up,
lets hit him up 
the library is where ill find him. 


A mask, 
a dove, 
an instrument played in the name of love,
the hallways blurred, in the face of dusk. 
the hallways lit, by the lovers mark. 
And yet their heart's forever dark.
