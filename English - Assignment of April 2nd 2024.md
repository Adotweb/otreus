1. Elizabeth Proctor is John Proctor’s wife, known for her virtue and honesty, but she's accused of witchcraft. Ezekiel Cheever is a man from Salem who acts as the clerk of the court during the witch trials.
2. Mary Warren is in Salem because she’s an official of the court; it’s implied she enjoys the power and respect it gives her.
3. Elizabeth wants John to go to Salem to tell the authorities that the girls are lying about the witchcraft.
4. Their relationship is strained; John has been unfaithful, and Elizabeth struggles with trust.
5. Mary gives Elizabeth a "poppet" (a small doll) she made in court.
6. The "evidence" against Sarah Good is that she mumbles after begging for cider and bread, which is interpreted as curses.
7. Elizabeth thinks Abigail wants to kill her to take her place as John's wife.
8. Hale comes to Proctor's house to question them as part of the witchcraft investigation.
9. The Proctors are suspicious because they don’t go to church regularly and their youngest son isn’t baptized.
10. Cheever comes to arrest Elizabeth after finding a needle in the “poppet” Mary gave her, which matches Abigail’s accusation of being stabbed with a needle.
11. The needle in the "poppet" is significant because it's used as "proof" that Elizabeth used witchcraft to harm Abigail Williams.
12. Mary doesn’t want to testify about the doll because she’s afraid of Abigail's retaliation and the court’s power.
